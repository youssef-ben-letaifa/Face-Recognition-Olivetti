# Olivetti Faces Classification ‚Äì face recognition using the Olivetti Faces dataset

Welcome to the **face recognition using the Olivetti Faces dataset** project!  
This repository provides a professional, end-to-end workflow for face recognition using the Olivetti Faces dataset, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook with clear explanations and modern machine learning best practices.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform facial recognition and analysis on the Olivetti Faces dataset using Python and scikit-learn. The notebook guides you through:

- **Data exploration & visualization**: Understand the dataset, visualize faces and target distribution.
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to extract Eigenfaces and reduce feature space.
- **Model training & evaluation**: Compare multiple classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression, LDA, etc.) with robust metrics.
- **Cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning**: Ensure accuracy and generalization using k-fold, leave-one-out CV, and grid search.
- **Advanced metrics**: Precision-recall curves for multi-class analysis.
- **Modular, pipeline-based workflow**: Professional, reusable code for experiments and further research.
